<H1>Evaluation of packing</H1>
<P>The <B>Occluded Surface Packing Value (OSP)</B> is calculated for each residue. This value is 0.0 for completely exposed
residues and is 1.0 for the impossible case where 100% of molecular surface
is in contact with other van der Waals surface. The average for a protein
is dependent on the molecular weight of the protein. </P>
<P>For each atom that has occluded surface, the value of <B>(os*[1-raylength])</B> is calculated. 
Here <B>raylength</B> is the fractional length of the extended normal. (A fractional length of 1.0 is equivalent to the diameter of a water molecule, 2.8 Ang.)
These values are summed for each residue to give the parameter
listed in column four of the output file below. This parameter is divided by the<I> <B>total surface area</B></I> for that amino acid type to give a <B><A NAME="nrmlpakval">normalized occluded surface packing value</B></A> listed under &quot;<B>OSP</B>&quot; in the output file. </P>
<P>Thus, if the complete residue surface is occluded, and all rays have a length
of zero, the packing value is the same as the total residue surface area
and <B>OSP</B> = 1.0. </P>

<P>Output is in the file, <I>prot.pak</I> </P>

<P><B>Note</B>: If a residue has zero occluded surface the residue name
will not be listed as for residue 75, above. </P>
<HR>
<P>The output file, <I>pak.plt</I>, contains columns 1 and 5 from the above file <B>without </B>the column labels for plotting <B>residue numbe</B>r <I>versus</I> <B>OSP</B>. </P>

<P><B>Note for ligands in OS:</B> To calculate the ligand/protein <B><TT>OS</TT></B> and <B><TT>os*[1-raylen]</TT></B> change the name of the ligand to <B><TT>UNK</TT></B> in the <B>prot.srf </B>file. The program <B>respak</B> will not calculate parameters for unrecognized residue names.</P>
