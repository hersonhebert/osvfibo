<H1>Evaluation of OS environment</H1>
<P>The <B>occluded surface </B>area for each residue is compared to the distribution of occluded surface areas for that type of amino acid in a data set of high resolution structures. The output is found in the file, <I>prot.eval</I> as shown below.
<P>The two important parameters here are <B>Ri</B> and <B>Psr</B>. A plot of <B>Ri</B> tells you which residues are in unusual environments. And <B>Psr</B> should be between 0.60 and 0.74 or your structure is probably wrong.

<P>where,
<P><B>Sw</B> is a weighted surface area of the residue. This parameter is a function of both the occluded surface area of the residue and the distribution of occluded surface areas found in a data set of high resolution structures.
<P><B>St</B> is the total surface area for that residue type.
<DL>
<DT><B>Ri</B> is a weighted parameter describing how &quot;usual&quot; the occluded surface environment is:
<DD> Below a value of 0.2 indicates that the residue is in a highly unusual environment.
<DD>A value of 1.0 indicates that the residue is in a completely average environment for that residue type.
</DL>
<P><B>Total_Res</B> is the total number of residues
<P><B>Pw</B> is the weighted surface area of the whole protein
<P><B>Pi</B> is the ideal weighted surface area of a protein with the same amino acid composition.
<P><B>Psr</B> is the normalized protein surface ratio. A value between 0.60 - 0.74 is found for <I>properly folded proteins</I>. If your structure has a <B>Psr</B> value outside of this range it is probably wrong.
