<P><B>OS</B> is a package of programs to calculate the <B>occluded surface</B> and <B>atomic packing</B> of protein model structures.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Occluded surface</B> is defined as the molecular surface that is less than 2.8 Angstroms from
the surface of neighboring non-bonded atoms. That is, if a water molecule <B>cannot</B> fit between
 two atoms they occlude each other. Occluded surface is similar
to buried surface but is more sensitive to packing geometry than buried
surface identified using a rolling probe. </P>

<P>To calculate occluded surface, normals at the molecular surface are extended
outward until they intersect neighboring van der Waals surface. The collection
of extended normals, and their respective lengths, defines the <B>packing</B> of
 each atom in a structural model. The figure above on the left illustrates this concept.</P>

<ul>
<li>
Either the <b>normals</b> or the molecular surface <b>patches</b> (above right) that represent the occluded surface may be displayed in PyMOL using scripts provided.
</li>
<P>
<li>
Analysis of the <B>occluded surface</B> enables one to identify amino acid residues in
 <I>unusual occluded surface environments</I> compared to a database of high resolution structures. 
Residues in an unusual
environment are frequently <B>incorrectly modeled</B>, involved in<B> crystal contacts</B>, 
or involved in <B>ligand binding</B>.
</li>
<p>
<li>
A weighted parameter, <B>Psr</B>, related to the <B>occluded surface</B> is 
within a narrow range for native protein structures; if a protein model
has a <B>Psr</B> value outside this range the model is probably wrong in at least some areas. </P>
</li>
<P>
<li>Analysis of the collection of extended normals (<B>raylengths</B>) and their associated occluded 
surface enables an estimation of the <B>packing</B> of the protein both at the <B>residue level</B>
 and for the protein as a <B>whole</B>. The <I>output list </I>identifies all atoms which interact with each atom in the structure, the
surface area involved in the interaction and the average raylength for that
interacting patch of surface area. 
</li>
<p>
<li>
A combination of <b>occluded surface area</b> and <b>average length of the normals</b>
may be used to obtain the <B>Occluded Surface Packing (OSP)</b> value for each residue.
These residue <B>OSP</B> values are useful for identifying regions of close packing versus areas
of loose packing in a protein. 
</li>
<p>
<li>
Analysis of <B>inter-chain occluded surface</B> allows a detailed calculation of protein-protein interactions.</P>
</li>

<P><B>Use of the program requires four files:</B> </P>

<P><B>1.</B> A <B>PDB</B> <B>file</B> of coordinates. This must be a '<B>clean</B>' file with no <I>alternate 
conformations</I>; no <I>hydrogens</I>; and only <I>one chain</I>. You should <I>renumber</I> your multi-chain 
files to be <I>sequentially</I> numbered, otherwise the output will be unintelligible because chain identifiers
are not kept. </P>
<P>A script to clean up a PDB file is described <A HREF="extract_descrip.html">here</A>. </P>
<P>A simple <A NAME="renumber">FORTRAN</A> program to renumber your clean PDB file is included in the OS distribution. 
<BR>
Edit your [<i>PDBCode</i>].<i>pdb</i> (or [<i>PDBCode</i>].<i>cln</i>) file so that the first residue has the number you want to start with.
<BR>
Then launch the [<i>path</i>]/<i>os_v75</i>/<i>bin</i>/<i>renum</i> program from the command line and follow the prompt. Your renumbered file will be called <i>new.pdb</i>.

</P>
<P>How to handle RNA, DNA, prosthetic groups and other ligands is described <A HREF="ligands.html">here</A>. </P>

<P><B>2.</B> A <B>command file</B>, <I>os.run</I> </P>
<P>A sample file is in the OS distribution. You should <B>uncomment the appropriate lines</B> in <I>os.run</I> 
to run the different programs in the package. </P>
<P>An example of <I>os.run</I> is <A HREF="os_run.txt">here</A>. </P>

<P><B>3. </B>A <B>data file</B>, <I>os.fil</I>, which tells <B>OS</B> the PDB filename, the residue numbers to calculate, and whether or not
you want a file to display the occluded patches and/or normals using PyMOL. </P>
<P>An example of <I>os.fil</I> with further explanation is <A HREF="os.fil.html">here</A>. </P>

<P><B>4.</B> An <B>atom radii</B> file, <I>radii</I> </P>
A default <A HREF="radii.txt">radii file</a> is supplied and will be read by the program. If you want to use your own radii set,
edit the file, <i>radii</I>, in the <i>data</i> subdirectory of the OS distribution.
